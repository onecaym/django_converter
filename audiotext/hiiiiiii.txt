最接近的時刻會根據你的確切位置而有所不同，但本週末和下周初的任何一個晚上都將提供火星和天王星結合的壯觀景色。 正如在北半球所見，它們將在當地時間午夜左右在東部一起升起，並在東南部高處可見，直到日出前約兩小時。

Look around 1:00 a.m. local time where you are, with the very closest conjunctions visible early on Monday (Aug. 1) and Tuesday (Aug. 2).

You should also be able to see the Pleiades — the brightest open cluster of stars in the night sky — close to the two planets.
How to see the Mars-Uranus conjunction

Although it's technically possible for some stargazers to see Uranus with the naked eye under perfectly dark conditions, it's a much better bet to use binoculars or a small telescope. Binoculars will reveal both planets in the same field of view. Mars will appear reddish while Uranus a blue-green hue. 

Another option is to watch a live webcast by the Virtual Telescope Project, which will be broadcasting live views of the Mars-Uranus conjunction (opens in new tab) through a telescope from Rome, Italy at 9 p.m. EDT on Aug. 1 (01:00 UTC on Aug. 2).
Why Mars is brighter than Uranus

The two planets will not be the same brightness during their conjunction. Mars is gradually brightening in the night sky as it gets closer to Earth and will this weekend it will shine at a magnitude of 0.2, which is about the same as a bright star. It will be about 130 million miles (208 million km) from Earth. That's a lot closer than the much larger ice-giant Uranus, which will be a whopping 2 billion miles (3.2 billion km) distant and will shine at a magnitude of just 5.8. That's right on the limit of naked-eye visibility.
